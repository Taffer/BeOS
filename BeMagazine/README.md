# BeMagazine

An article demoing scripting on BeOS, circa 1999, written for the long-departed
BeMagazine.

The Python and shell code here is absolutely ancient; I'm afraid to even look
at its potential awfulness after all this time. :blush:

I don't seem to have an HTML or text version of the Gobe-format docs
anywhere; if someone can convert them from Gobe Productive format, please let
me know and I'll include the more portable versions here.

## What's Here

* `gettitles.py` - Python scripting example. Requires the `heymodule`, which I think is still available somewhere.
* `gettitles.sh` - Shell scripting sample. Requires the `hey` command.
* `Gobe-docs` - BeOS scripting articles/documentation in Gobe Productive format.
* `Scripting-01_B.txt` - Text version of the scripting article.
* `StyledEdit-Window.png` - Vintage BeOS screen shot! :scream:
