# DragonDrop

This is a drag and drop demo that I wrote while I was doing contract technical
writing for Be, Inc. back in the day.

The C++ code here is absolutely ancient; I'm afraid to even look
at its potential awfulness after all this time. :blush: It's probably full of
security issues, poor programming practices, and targets an amazingly obsolete
version of C++...

## What's Here

* `app_info.rsrc` - Application resources.
* `*.h`, `*.cpp` - Source code.
* `images.rsrc` - Images resources. I have no idea where these came from originally.
* `LICENSE` - The original Be Sample Code License.
* `Makefile` - BeOS `Makefile` for code built with the OS.
* `README.html` - Original docs.
* `strings.rsrc` - Application strings; go ahead and translate this and add internationalization support!
