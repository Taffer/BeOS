<h1>DragonDrop &mdash; a drag 'n' drop demo</h1>

<p>
DragonDrop is a little demo application demonstrating the concepts
documented in the 
<a href="file:///boot/beos/documentation/Be%20Book/index.html">BeBook</a>'s 
drag-n-drop documentation.  It also does several other interesting (to 
developers) things:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	all strings are stored in resources, allowing for easy translation 
	(loaded via 
	<a href="file:///boot/develop/headers/be/storage/ResourceStrings.h"><tt>BResourceStrings</tt></a>)
	</li>

	<li>
	loads bitmaps from the resources (using the
	<a href="file:///boot/beos/documentation/Be%20Book/The%20Translation%20Kit/TranslationUtils.html"><tt>BTranslationUtils</tt></a>
	class)
	</li>

	<li>
	accepts any kind of bitmap from drag-n-drop (courtesy of the
	<a href="file:///boot/beos/documentation/Be%20Book/The%20Translation%20Kit/index.html">Translation
	Kit</a>)
	</li>

	<li>
	can send any kind of bitmap during a drag-n-drop (courtesy of the
	<a href="file:///boot/beos/documentation/Be%20Book/The%20Translation%20Kit/index.html">Translation
	Kit</a>)
	</li>

	<li>
	can create clipping files in any kind of bitmap format by dragging to
	the Tracker or a Tracker-like application (courtesy of the
	<a href="file:///boot/beos/documentation/Be%20Book/The%20Translation%20Kit/index.html">Translation
	Kit</a>)
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
The code is also extensively documented; it should be easy to follow.

<h2>About the Images</h2>

<p>
The spiffy images that are built into this application's resources are
<a href="http://www.cdrom.com/pub/png/">PNG images</a>, and thus have their
own built-in alpha channel, which makes them interesting for drag-n-drop
operations.  The images in question came from the PNG Group's set of
<a href="http://www.cdrom.com/pub/png/pngs-img.html">sample images</a>, and 
have the following copyright information:
