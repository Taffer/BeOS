OTTAWA, Ontario -- November 10, 1998 -- heymodule 1.1 is now available 
from Chris Herborth's web pages (http://www.qnx.com/~chrish/Be/software/); 
version 1.1 enhances the original heymodule with:

- cleaned up source code (still not available, but contact the author at
  chrish@qnx.com if you absolutely must have it ASAP; special consideration
  given to people trying to get scripting working from other languages like
  perl, etc.)

- cleaned up and improved documentation

- fixed a bug that would prevent you from re-using specifiers

What is heymodule?

heymodule is a Python add-on that lets you write BeOS scripting applications
in Python.  This is the first proof that you can do BeOS scripting from
*any* language!

BeOS's language-neutral scripting support lets you "remote-control" any
GUI application, automating repetitive tasks, tying applications together,
and doing things the application authors never imagined.

heymodule comes with extensive documentation and several examples, including
a Python version of one of the sample scripts being included (in 
shell-script form) in the BeOS Bible, to be published soon by Peachpit 
Press!

Drawbacks

Currently heymodule and the BeOS port of Python are PowerPC only; I'm
working on an x86 port for R4, and hope to have it available ASAP.
