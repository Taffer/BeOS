# BeOS code by `chrish`

Ãže olde BeOS code from dayes of yore.

At the urging of a couple of folks on Twitter (<a href="https://twitter.com/jessic4h">@jessic4h</a>
and (<a href="https://twitter.com/waddlesplash">@waddlesplash</a> this time) I finally went
through my archives to see if I could find any old BeOS code.

The good news is that I found some, which is now in this repo.

The bad news is that I couldn't find any of my <a href="http://www.jwz.org/xscreensaver/">XScreenSaver</a> 
ports.

If I were porting XScreenSaver to a new environment these days, I'd check out
jwz's Mac OS X port code and do something along those lines... he's already
solved the hard bits for you, you just need to implement the OS-specific parts.

## What I Found

* `BeMagazine` - An article and related code about scripting on BeOS.
* `DragonDrop` - Sample code demonstrating how to implement drag and drop in BeOS.

## License

This stuff is released under an MIT license; I'm sure Be, Inc. would be tickled
that people are still interested!
